				<p>
					Dontogan can be considered as a pretty decent barangay in Baguio. Although it is a little far from the
					city, the trip will be worth it. The environment compared to the city is entirely different, you would
					think as though you are in the countryside. It wouldn't be considered entirely free of trash and pollution
					but its still better as compared to your stereotypical city.<br>

					Not to mention the community clean up, several projects can also be seen to have been implemented for the sake of its people. It can be seen that a public basketball court and a playground was built. These facilities provide the people, especially the young ones, a good livelihood.<br>

					The welfare of the community can be attributed to the responsible governance of its local administration.
