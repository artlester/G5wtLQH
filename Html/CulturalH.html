Tomas, Baguio City's highest summit at 5,000 Feet above sea level-is a community of people who adapted to their environment and to the demands of a ever-changing world keeping alive their own values and traditions from mixed cultures and heritages. Barangay Dontogan, as it is known, was once a component part of a larger district collectively known as Sto. Tomas. It was in 1963 that the Barrio Council saw the need to establish a separate district from Sto. Tomas in acknowledgement of the new reality a growing neighborhood district from the other communities. Their act have birth to what is today Barangay or "Shontog" for which in Ibaloi means "mountain". Dontogan then would refer to a mountainous place.</p>
