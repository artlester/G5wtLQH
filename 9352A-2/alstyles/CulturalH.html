				<h4>History</h4>

				<p>Nestled at the panoramic and famous Mount Sto. Tomas, Baguio City's highest summit at 5,000 Feet above sea level-is a community of people who adapted to their environment and to the demands of a ever-changing world keeping alive their own values and traditions from mixed cultures and heritages. Barangay Dontogan, as it is known, was once a component part of a larger district collectively known as Sto. Tomas. It was in 1963 that the Barrio Council saw the need to establish a separate district from Sto. Tomas in acknowledgement of the new reality a growing neighborhood district from the other communities. Their act have birth to what is today Barangay or "Shontog" for which in Ibaloi means "mountain". Dontogan then would refer to a mountainous place.</p>
				<p>Dontogan was not the original name. It was named by the Cordillera city of Baguio. This land is in Shuyo, Wetig, Tuba Central, Benguet Luzon. It was surveyed by Ikang Paus in 1914, and in 1917 an American Original Certificate Title 13 was issued and was registered in the City of Baguio at the same year. It comprises 3 parcels of land. Lot 1 56.92 hectares owned now by Basil Family; Lot 2 34.37 hectares and Lot 3 10.15 hectares more or less. A total of 101.81 hectares.</p>
